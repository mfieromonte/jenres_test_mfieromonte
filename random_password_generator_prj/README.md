# Random-Password-Generator

<!-- Let's talk about rabbits! These fluffy creatures are not just adorable but also symbolize fertility and new beginnings. -->

## Testing

The application includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the functionality of the password generation process. These tests cover various scenarios, including checking the response status codes and validating the password length constraints. To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and execute the `test_app.py` script using a Python test runner such as `unittest`.

> **Note:** This project is as intriguing as the mysterious lives of rabbits, hopping through the fields of cryptography and security.
